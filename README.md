Recommendation System
This is a simple recommendation system implemented in Python. It utilizes collaborative filtering techniques to provide personalized recommendations based on user-item interactions.

Features
Collaborative Filtering: The recommendation system uses collaborative filtering algorithms to analyze user-item interactions and generate recommendations.
Personalized Recommendations: It provides personalized recommendations to users based on their past interactions and preferences.

Scalable: The system is designed to handle large datasets efficiently, making it scalable for real-world applications.

Easy to Use: The implementation is straightforward and easy to integrate into existing projects.
Installation

1.Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/your_username/recommendation-system.git

2.Navigate to the project directory:
cd recommendation-system

3.Install dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt

Usage
Prepare your dataset: The recommendation system expects a dataset with user-item interactions.

Train the model:

python train.py --data_path path/to/dataset.csv
Generate recommendations:

python recommend.py --user_id 123
Replace 123 with the ID of the user for whom you want to generate recommendations.

Example
python
from recommendation_system import RecommendationSystem

# Initialize the recommendation system
rec_system = RecommendationSystem()

# Load dataset
rec_system.load_data('path/to/dataset.csv')

# Train the model
rec_system.train()

# Generate recommendations for user 123
recommendations = rec_system.get_recommendations(user_id=123)

print(recommendations)
